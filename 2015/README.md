# Advent Of Code 2015
My set of Python solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015) problems

## How do I use this?
This is old, use python2.7.

For day _N_, just run:
`$ python advN.py`

For day _N_ part 2:
`$ python advN.py 2`

If you are still having problems to understand, this will retrieve the answer for day 8:
`$ python adv8.py`

## Okay, fine. I got it. How do I change the input to fit the one generated for me?
All these scripts expect a text file in the same directory. So **adv4.py** expects **input4.txt**, **adv7.py** expects **input7.txt** and so on. You can just replace the content of these files...


## Why are there files missing?
The first assignments were so easy to solve using python, I just typed in the python shell that I already was using for other purposes. I may or may not add previous solutions and I also may or may not separate these scripts in folders.
